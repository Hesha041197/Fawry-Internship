1.  A breakdown of how your script handles arguments and options:

The script will first check if the first argument is `--help` and if it is then it will call the `Syntax` function otherwise it will move on to the next condition and check if the argument is `-n`, If it is then it will set the variable `show_line_numbers` to true otherwise it will move on to the next condition and check if the argument is `-v` and if it is then it will set `invert_search` to true otherwise it will move on to the last condition and check if the argument is `-nv` or `-vn` and if so it will set both variables to true.

The variables will be handled inside the while loop in if conditions to print the correct/desired output



2.  A short paragraph: If you were to support regex or -i/-c/-l options, how would your structure change?

We can use `getopts` for cleaner and easier option handling. We can also use awk and sed as they're powerful tools



3.  What part of the script was hardest to implement and why?

the `Highlight` function as I had to figure out how to exclude special characters and use awk
